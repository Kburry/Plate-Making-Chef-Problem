## Drawings
The Drawings can be found in the drawings folder.

## Running on eclipse.
1. Right Click on Runner and click run as java application.
2. The output should be seen on console.
3. If you run into problems right click on maven clean and maven test and clean the project by project>clean. Then Run again. 
4. only issue I have had is an attempt to build with java 9 and then run on 1.8 which causes issues, this can be fixed by going to the compiler and telling it to run 1.8.

## Random Note
Intellij is so much nicer.
